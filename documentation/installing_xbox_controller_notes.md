In order to test YAM's lower-level systems or to provide training input, it may be beneficial to connect an Xbox controller into ROS. 

I have jotted down my notes for hooking up my Xbox One controller below.

##1. ROS
Install the ROS driver via `sudo apt install ros-melodic-joystick-drivers`

##2. Connect the controller
